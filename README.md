#  Thrive

This project is an experimental 2D game focused on **observation, interpretation, and indirect control** rather than direct player action.

The player does not act as a character in the world.  
They act as an external intelligence that perceives and influences beings through limited, abstract information.

---

## Core Gameplay Idea

- The player observes beings through an **abstract view** rather than a visual world.
- Beings are not directly controllable by default.
- Influence and control require **understanding**, not force.
- Misinterpretation has permanent consequences.

---

## Perception System

The primary view presents the world as a **black background** populated by abstract indicators rather than physical entities.

Beings are represented through **energy strands** associated with internal states such as:
- Anger
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happiness
- Sadness
- Vitality

Each strand is defined only by simple properties (e.g. type, intensity, persistence).  
Strands are intentionally ambiguous and do not explain themselves.

---

## Observation (Behavior-Based Information)

When selecting a being, the player is shown:
- A log of **actions and behaviors**
- Sequences of events
- Repeated patterns

The player is **not shown**:
- Explicit emotions
- Thoughts
- Desires
- Numerical stats

All interpretation must be inferred from behavior and abstract signals.

---

## Interpretation & Decision Making

Each being operates based on internal motivations that are **hidden from the player**.

The player’s role is to:
- Observe patterns
- Infer underlying needs or conflicts
- Decide whether and how to intervene

There is no explicit confirmation that an interpretation is correct.

---

## Influence & Intervention

The player may attempt indirect influence through limited actions such as:
- Altering perceptions
- Introducing symbolic events
- Creating contextual changes

These actions:
- Affect future behavior
- Carry risk
- May increase resistance or rejection

Intervention is never guaranteed to succeed.

---

## Commitment & Irreversibility

At certain points, the player may attempt a **commitment action** based on their interpretation.

Outcomes depend on:
- Timing
- Accuracy of interpretation
- Prior interactions

Some failures result in the being becoming **permanently unreachable**, removing them from further influence.

---

## Design Principles

- Information is intentionally incomplete
- Systems favor ambiguity over clarity
- Failure is persistent, not reset-based
- The player is rewarded for restraint and insight
- The game avoids explicit moral or mechanical labels

---

## Project Status

This repository represents early-stage design and prototyping.  
Systems and concepts are subject to change.

---

## Goals

- Explore non-traditional player power
- Create gameplay based on interpretation rather than optimization
- Emphasize consequence over control
